There are two ways to make them "usable" on your system. One way is install
them from a standard Slackware .txz package. You can run
sbo-dev-helper.SlackBuild in the build/ folder which in under the top folder of
the source. In this way, all the scripts will be installed to your /usr/bin/
and docs to /usr/doc/sbo-dev-helper-$VERSION respectively. This can be
convenience if you want multiple users use the scripts ;)

However, the second way of installing which is more "clean" and ideal for personal
use is untar the source ball, and then just symlink the files under bin/ to the
top folder of the SlackBuilds you maintain. Then you can run the utilities from
there relatively.
