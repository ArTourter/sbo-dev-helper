Settings
========

In order to use these utilities, you need to set some variables to let them
know your system configuration. You must set:

  SBO_DIR="/abusolute/pathto/where/official/sborepo"
  SBO_TEMPLATES="/absolute/pathto/the/template/folder"
  SBO_NAME="Your Name"
  SBO_MAIL="Your@mail.address"

in either ~/.sbo-dev-helver.cfg or in your ~/.profile or any thing like that.
Note ~/.sbo-dev-helver.cfg has priority over environment settings. Meanings of
some variables will be described below.

SBO_DIR
=======

The absolute path to your local SBo repository. There should be the
ChangeLog.txt right under it.

SBO_TEMPLATES
=============

Some of these scripts demand SBO_TEMPLATES variable which is the path to where
you store the templates. The templates folder should have the same thing that
http://www.slackbuilds.org/templates/ have. You can run update_sbo_tpl to
retrive all the files.
